Walking in the dark now I just some cookies
Which is not for you I now is not
I just get burn and melts in my mouth
Trying into me is now POPCORN
Can't You Understand?
Can't you understand boy?
So take rest
So take a rest, SUCKER
Walking in the dark now I jam some cookies
Which is not for you I now is not
I just get burn and melts in my mouth
Trying into me is now POPCORN
Can't You Understand?
Can't you understand boy?
So take rest
So take a rest, SUCKER
Oh No
So take a Rest, SUCKER
NO MORE IDEAS
NO MORE IDEAS
IS OVER!
